*Warning:*

As expected from a 48h competition entry, the quality of this code might hurt your eyes.

# Story

After years of slumber, the sleeping volcano is waking up.

The island's only hope are the 4 magic lullabies. Legend says that such songs can bring the volcano back into a deep sleep.

This is a job for Lola Bay, explorer and opera singer!

**Can you find all the songs and delay the inevitable eruption?**

# Instructions

Collect all songs scattered through the island before the volcano wakes up.

Each song that you collect and sing will make the volcano sleep a bit longer, so you get more time to finish the game.

# Controls

- **Arrow keys:** Move
- **Space:** Jump

# Hints

If you get stuck on the temple level (reverse)llaw eht no sgniward eht ta kool(/reverse).

# Dev notes

The compo version of the game was build using a snapshot version of Minart: https://github.com/JD557/minart/tree/d79b4847e7694148487061e31f863ecd86a14f50

Unfortunately, during the development of the game I found some issues with the library.
I might publish an RC once I fix those issues, to make compilation easier.

Tools:
 - Scala
 - Minart
 - LibreSprite
 - Gimp
 - MuseScore
 - Audacity
